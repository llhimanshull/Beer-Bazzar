üöÄ **Project Title & Tagline**

**Project Name:** Beer Blog
**Tagline:** A Node.js RESTful API for managing a beer blog, featuring authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations for beers, blogs, reviews, and visitors.

üìñ **Description**

Beer Blog is a Node.js project that provides a RESTful API for managing a beer blog. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) beers, blogs, reviews, and visitors. The API is built using Express.js, a popular Node.js web framework, and MongoDB for data storage.

The project includes the following key features:

* User authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and cookie-based authentication
* Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing access to API endpoints
* CRUD operations for beers, blogs, reviews, and visitors
* Image upload and resizing using the Sharp library
* Error handling and logging using Winston

This README provides an overview of the project, including its features, technical stack, project structure, and instructions for running and testing the application.

‚ú® **Features**

1. **User Authentication**: Users can authenticate using a username and password, and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) that can be used to access protected API endpoints.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The API includes role-based access control, which allows administrators to manage access to API endpoints based on user roles.
3. **CRUD Operations**: The API provides CRUD operations for beers, blogs, reviews, and visitors, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data.
4. **Image Upload and Resizing**: The API includes image upload and resizing capabilities using the Sharp library.
5. **Error Handling and Logging**: The API includes error handling and logging using Winston, allowing for easy debugging and troubleshooting.
6. **API Endpoints**: The API includes a range of endpoints for managing beers, blogs, reviews, and visitors, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
7. **Data Validation**: The API includes data validation using Mongoose schemas, ensuring that data is valid and consistent across the application.
8. **Security**: The API includes security features such as HTTPS encryption and rate limiting to prevent abuse and unauthorized access.
